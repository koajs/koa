  Expressive middleware for node.js using generators via [co](https://github.com/visionmedia/co)
  to make writing web applications and REST APIs more enjoyable to write.

  Only methods that are common to nearly all HTTP servers are integrated directly into Koa's small ~400 SLOC codebase. This
  includes things like content-negotiation, normalization of node inconsistencies, redirection, and a few others.

  No middleware are bundled with koa. If you prefer to only define a single dependency for common middleware, much like Connect, you may use
  [koa-common](https://github.com/koajs/common).

## Installation

```
$ npm install koa
```

  To use Koa, your version of node must have generator support.
  There are currently two ways to achieve this:

  - Use __node 0.11.3__ or higher and run node(1) with the `--harmony-generators` flag.
    If you don't like typing this, add an alias to your shell profile:

    ```bash
    alias node='node --harmony-generators'
    ```

  - Use [gnode](https://github.com/TooTallNate/gnode).

## Example

```js
var koa = require('koa');
var app = koa();

// logger

app.use(function(next){
  return function *(){
    var start = new Date;
    yield next;
    var ms = new Date - start;
    console.log('%s %s - %s', this.method, this.url, ms);
  }
});

// response

app.use(function(next){
  return function *(){
    yield next;
    this.body = 'Hello World';
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Running tests

```
$ make test
```

## Benchmarks

  Average latency with one middleware:

    0.628ms

  Average latency with __400__ noop middleware:

    1.5ms

  If you like silly benchmarks, here's the requests per second:

```
1 middleware
8083.45

5 middleware
7449.95

10 middleware
7166.66

15 middleware
6992.18

20 middleware
6650.28

30 middleware
6113.57

50 middleware
5117.46
```

  With __50__ middleware (likely much more than you'll need), that's __307,020__ requests per minute, and __18,421,200__ per hour,  __442 million__ per day, so unless you're a facebook and can't manage to spin up more
  than one process to scale horizontally you'll be fine ;)
